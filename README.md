# Checking-password-strength-using-ML
Here we check the strength of the passwords whether they are weak or strong
we predict whether a given password is weak, strong or very strong 
we show the password strength as:
0 resembles weak
1 resembles strong and
2 resembles very strong.
Here we use different Machine Learning algorithms to predict the strength of the passwords.
